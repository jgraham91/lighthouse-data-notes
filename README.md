## Summary 

This repository contains all of the notes taken by Josh Graham for the Lighthouse Labs Data Science Bootcamp.

## Notes

I haven't taken any notes in here yet, I am writing them by hand like some kind of pleb.

I am excited to expand my skills in data science. The skill set will be complementary to the mathematical background I have as an Engineer and Naval Architect.
