What skills do I need to be a good data scientist?

  * Data science is a multidisciplinary field: applied mathematics, computer science and domain expertise are needed.
  * Mathematics is the backbone of the Data Science domain.
  * Most of the data science job roles will require programming skills that are related to the domain.
  * A good business sense is also a valuable asset for a data analyst and scientist. There is no purpose in just cleaning the data and getting insights from it as such. The insights will have a purpose only if the business problem has been identified and understood thoroughly.
  * Communication skills and the ability to work well with others are also very crucial.
